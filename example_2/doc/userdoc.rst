********************************************************
DiffBot with Gazebo Simulation World.
********************************************************

This example shows how to control a custom differential drive robot (diffbot) using ``gz_ros2_control::GazeboSimROS2ControlPlugin`` and Gazebo built-in ``gz::sim::systems::DiffDrive`` plugin in Rubicon world.

.. include:: ../../doc/run_from_docker.rst

Tutorial steps
--------------------------

1. To start *DiffBot* example in Rubicon world with ``gz_ros2_control::GazeboSimROS2ControlPlugin`` plugin, open a terminal, source your ROS2-workspace and execute its launch file with

  .. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch ros2_control_demo_ext_example_2 diffbot_rubicon.launch.py


  The launch file loads and starts the robot hardware, and opens *Gazebo GUI*. You may need to zoom out to see the robot in *Gazebo GUI*.

2. To drive around the robot, open another terminal and execute

  .. code-block:: shell

    ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard --ros-args -p stamped:=true

  Follow the instructions to move the robot using keyboard. Rubicon world is a difficult terrain so you may need to drive slowly and press ``k`` key time to time to stop the robot.

3. To start *DiffBot* example with Gazebo ``gz::sim::systems::DiffDrive`` plugin, stop the commands from previous steps. Then run following command

  .. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch ros2_control_demo_ext_example_2 diffbot_rubicon.launch.py sim_plugin:=gz_sim


  The launch file loads and starts the robot hardware, and opens *Gazebo GUI*. You may need to zoom out to see the robot in *Gazebo GUI*.

4. To drive around the robot, from Gazebo GUI, search and add ``Teleop`` plugin. Under ``Teleop`` plugin, click on ``KEYBOARD``, then follow the instructions to move the robot.
