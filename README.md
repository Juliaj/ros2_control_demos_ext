# Extended Set of Demos for ros2_control

## Content

The following examples are part of this demo repository:

* Example 1: [*AckermannBot*](example_1)

   *AckermannBot* - a simple robot runs in Gazebo simulation with `ackermann_steering_controller/AckermannSteeringController` from `ros2_control`. This example is to investiagate the idea of using unpownered wheel for odometry calculation because the odometry may not be accurate when powered wheels slip under certain scenarios such as high inertia or highly slippery ground.
